identifyLoners(v, nMax = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{v}{A character or factor variable to check.}

\item{nMax}{The maximum number of problematic values to report. Default is \code{Inf}, in which case
all problematic values are included in the outputtet message.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements, $problem: TRUE if any loners were found, FALSE otherwise, and
$message A message describing which values in \code{v} were loners. Note that loner values
