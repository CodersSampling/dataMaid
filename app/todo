To do:
- Add pdf viewer to Report tab if pdf is chosen
- Making a pdf report and then setting "output" to html crashes the application. Why?
- Handle SAS, Stata and csv
- More options for data loading?
- Formatting of checkfunction-matrix
- Write help-page
- Handle e.g. when "Please wait" is clicked (tryCatch?)
- Data-loading: If the datafile is large, do not update (reload) data without a specific command to do so
- Find out if latex works on a shiny server at all (check texlive 2014)
